# Capture Simulator/Emulator screens on demand

Buddy project to capture screens of Android Emulators or iPhone Simulator on demand and save the screen recording as GIF.


## How it works

Install [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman), [redis](https://redis.io/), [imagemagick](https://www.imagemagick.org) and [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/).

Create a new Python environment and install requirements.

Launch foreman with `foreman s`. This will launch a service in `http://localhost:5000/' you can use to start and stop a recording session.

The service takes a screenshot of the window every second and save the image into `captures` folder. Once you request stop the screen recording all the images will attached to a gif file and saved into `videos` folder.


### Start a recording session

`http://localhosto:5000/capture/<device>`

Where `<device>` could be `android` or `iphone`.

If everything is ok, the service will respond you with an **id** that you need to use to stop the service.


### Stop a recording session

`http://localhosto:5000/stop/<id>`

Where `<id>` is the id you received when you started the recording session.

Returns the name and the path of the gif generated.


## Others scripts

The screen recording uses a binary executable to identifies all the windows. You can find this script into `helpers` folder as `GetWindowList`. If you need recompilate this executable you can do it using `generate_window_script.sh`.
